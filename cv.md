    Forensic Scientist

    I am assisting technicians using chemical treatments to obtain fingerprints
    from all types of materials. The first assessment I undertook was a visual
    examination as this is non-destructive. I then examined materials with glue,
    dye and ninhydrin.

    I attended the scene of a burglary with the scenes of crime investigator,
    where I assisted in looking for any fingerprints left by the intruder using
    aluminium powder and an applicator. We dusted points of entry, exit and area
    of disturbance in the house.
